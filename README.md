# Dynamic-pricing-parking-lots
Dynamic pricing model for urban parking lots using real-time data and intelligent feature engineering â€” built during Summer Analytics 2025.
#  Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots

## Project Overview
This project aims to implement a dynamic pricing system for urban parking lots based on real-time data such as occupancy, traffic, vehicle type, and queue length using the Pathway streaming engine.

## Tech Stack
-  Python
-  [Pathway](https://pathway.com/)
-  Pandas for preprocessing
-  Mermaid for architecture diagram
-  Git & GitHub
